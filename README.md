A Leap Motion Controlled Rolling Spider.

Palm position controls the drone.
* Palm pitch = forward and back.
* Palm yaw = CW and CCW.
* Palm roll = left and right.
* Pal height = drone height.

**You probably don't want this**
* I wrote this on a plane and I may have been drinking.
* I did not test because the flight attendants were mean.
* It *might* work... It might fly away... It might smack you in the face.

I'll test one day soon and make some docs.
